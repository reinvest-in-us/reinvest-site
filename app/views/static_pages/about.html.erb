      <p>
      We made this website to provide organizers, activists and engaged residents a simple organizing tool to get everyday citizens to their local City Council and/or other local elected body meetings.
      </p>
      <p>
      Local elected officials make big decisions on how to invest our dollars back into our community. These budget documents, often the most important vote any elected official makes, whether they sit on our local school board, state legislature or US Congress, are a reflection of our values and principles.
      </p>
      <p>
      Do you know the size of your city’s budget? It’s probably much larger than you think. Law enforcement budgets make up 40-50% of many cities' general fund budgets.
      </p>
      <p>
      We do not articulate an agenda nor have we drafted specific asks.  We believe this should be done organically in each of our communities.
      </p>
      <p>
      However, we are aware of how byzantine local decision making processes can be, despite the fact that millions and billions of our dollars are determined at these mostly under-attended meetings.
      </p>
      <p>
      We want to make the process of getting involved and speaking to your local elected representative simpler by putting all the information in one place.
      </p>
      <p>
      We also know that attending and witnessing these public meetings is much more powerful than sending an email or signing a petition to your local representative. So we invite you to attend a meeting of your local elected representatives. In our experience, participating directly makes a much larger impact in the long term to move public policy decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
      These are <span class="about-bold">our</span> dollars. Every single one of us contributes. Every time you make a purchase, work, pay a bus or toll fare, travel, you contribute to this collective fund.
      </p>
      <p>
      We can re-think how we invest our dollars, which we work so hard for, in ways we believe will actually make our communities safer. Well funded schools, early childhood education and after-school programs, jobs, beautiful parks and open space, well funded cultural institutions, health care for all and affordable housing ultimately make our communities and neighborhoods safer.
      </p>
      <p>
      We should <span class="about-bold">all</span> participate in choosing how to invest in our community.
